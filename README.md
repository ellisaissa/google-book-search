React-based Google Books Search app
This is supposed to search for books using Google. You're supposed to be able to type in a book or author and it gives you book listings with that name or books by that author.  Unfortunately, it doesn't always deploy properly and so doesn't properly work. I'll be coming back to this project to get it to work completely. Right now it says it can't find node server.js.
